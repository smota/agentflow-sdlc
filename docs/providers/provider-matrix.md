# Provider matrix

Facets are independently advertised: `inventory`, `project-adapters`, `execution`, `workspace`,
`evidence`, and `lifecycle`. Advanced behavior is not encoded in this table: `inspect()` returns
the current provider's `intentSupport`, implementation, fidelity, evidence level, and limits.

| Provider     | Proven facets       | Availability behavior              | Important limit                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `manual`     | execution, evidence | Always explicit                    | Human handoff; no automated launch               |
| `claude-cli` | execution, evidence | Non-shell `claude --version` probe | Project chooses execution target/model           |
| `codex-cli`  | execution, evidence | Non-shell `codex --version` probe  | Harness-native delegation is separate            |
| `agy-cli`    | execution, evidence | Non-shell `agy --version` probe    | Agy and Antigravity remain distinct identities   |
| `grok-cli`   | execution, evidence | Non-shell version/help probes      | Web disabled; delegation is intent-controlled    |
| `xai-api`    | execution, evidence | Unavailable until configured       | Explicit API invoker; never substitutes silently |

Pi is not a provider. It is a runtime platform and a harness adapter; see the
[glossary](../glossary.md). The `pi-cli` provider was removed, and a configuration or inspection that
names it fails with that message.

Inspecting a provider does not install it, authenticate it, edit project configuration, or widen the
current action boundary.

This matrix documents provider service surfaces, not a static capability promise. Use
`agentflow-sdlc providers inspect <id> --json` for the current runtime evidence.
