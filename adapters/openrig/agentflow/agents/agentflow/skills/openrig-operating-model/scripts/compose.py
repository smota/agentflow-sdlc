"""compose.py — leaf-to-root chain composition and subtree renders.

SUPERSEDED FOR REFOCUS: the public core reorientation trace lives at
../../refocusing/scripts/trace-to-root.py. This general composer remains the
compatibility surface for down/progress and historical up invocations.

  up   <start-dir> --name FILE [--name FILE ...] [--root DIR]
       Walk from start-dir up to root (default: filesystem stops at a dir
       containing .compose-root, or at --root). Emit the chain ROOT-FIRST
       (defaults, then overrides) with provenance headers, and a MISSING-LINK
       report for altitudes without the file — the scream is output, not error.

  down <root-dir> --name FILE [--name FILE ...] [--exclude GLOB ...]
       Gather every instance of the named files under root-dir.

  progress <root-dir> --name FILE [--name FILE ...] [--exclude GLOB ...]
       THE DERIVED PROGRESS VIEW (the PROGRESS.md prototype done right):
       count markdown checkboxes in the named files (the mark level), roll
       counts UP the tree, and print a walk-map-shaped tree with done/total
       per level. Never stored in any file — the render is the only home.
       Gather every instance of the named files under root-dir (the subtree
       render; run at the topology root = THE TRUNK RENDER). Sorted by path.

Composed output is GENERATED, NEVER EDITED (fragments are the source of truth).
Seals/locks bind to a render's bytes, not to fragments. Stdlib only.
